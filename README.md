## 8 1 tshirts

This project was the first time we put cookies and localstorage to use.  We used user authentication implemented by both localstorage and cookies used to log a customer in, persist a shopping cart of cool shirts, and place a mock order.

Uses:
React
Backbone.js
jQuery
Bootstrap
Sass
Parse - the server used to store data
Heroku - the hosting environment for said server
